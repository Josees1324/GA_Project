### How to play
-When the game loads player 1 starts and picks a number in a category to get a random question and that option goes away

-If player 1 gets the answer right they get that amount of points and goes again

-If player 1 get the answer wrong they lose that amount of points and its player 2's turn

-Player 2 then goes until they get an answer wrong and it switches back to player 1

-The game continues until a player reaches 10000 points and then the game resets
